# Emotion_Recognition
Emotion recognition is a very fundamental part of human interaction. This project sought out to develop a
machine learning model based on the FER2013 dataset through the use of traditional CNN architecture that
recognizes the seven basic emotions with the help of facial expressions. To increase the accuracy of the model
various procedures were carried out such as hyperparam-eter optimization using Random Search from the Keras
tuner library, testing out different number of convolution layers and different optimizers. The best model gave
69.55% test accuracy, which contained 8 convolution layers and used Ad-am optimizer.
